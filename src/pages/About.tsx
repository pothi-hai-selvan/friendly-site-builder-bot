              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
                The CODEC Club was first initiated by a passionate group of alumni from the ECE Department, Government College of Engineering, Erode. Their vision was to create a hub for innovation, knowledge sharing, and coding excellence â€” a space where students could go beyond the syllabus and explore real-world technology.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
                However, as the years passed and the original founders graduated, the club's activity slowly faded. What once echoed with collaboration and creativity eventually fell silent... like code waiting to be recompiled.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
                But in 2025, the spark was reignited.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
                Thanks to the support of our respected Head of Department, and the passion of a new wave of tech-driven students, CODEC Club was officially restored. With renewed energy and a future-ready mindset, the club began its second chapter â€” stronger, smarter, and more focused.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
                Leading this revival is S. P. Pothihai Selvan, our current Club President, who is dedicated to building a club where coding meets community â€” where every student has a place to learn, build, and inspire.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
                CODEC Club is not just a student group â€” it's a movement.
                A movement to create projects that matter, bridge the gap between books and reality, and leave behind a digital legacy for the next generation of ECE coders.

                Our name "CODEC" represents our dual focus on <strong>CO</strong>ding and <strong>DEC</strong>oding â€“ symbolizing the intersection of software and electronics that defines modern ECE education.

                Today, CODEC Club has over 150 active members from various years of the ECE department. We've completed dozens of collaborative projects, organized department-wide technical events, and established partnerships with tech companies to provide learning and career opportunities for our members.
